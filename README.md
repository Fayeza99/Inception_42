# Inception_42

## Project Overview

This repository contains the Inception project, a system administration exercise designed to deepen your understanding of Docker and virtualization. You will be setting up a small infrastructure with various services using Docker Compose, strictly within a virtual machine environment.

## Features

- **Docker-based Setup:** Utilize Docker Compose to manage multiple services within Docker containers.
- **Custom Dockerfiles:** Create and manage your own Dockerfiles for each service without pulling pre-made images (except for base images like Alpine or Debian).
- **Secure Configuration:** Configure services such as NGINX, WordPress, and MariaDB with security and performance in mind.

## What You Can Do With This Project

This project serves as a robust foundation for learning and experimentation with Docker and system administration within a controlled environment. Here are a few things you can do with it:

- **Educational Tool:** Use the setup to learn more about Docker, Docker Compose, and containerization technologies.
- **Development Environment:** Leverage the infrastructure to develop and test web applications in a secure and isolated environment.
- **Template for Projects:** Utilize the configurations as templates for setting up production-grade services with necessary customizations.
- **Security Practices:** Experiment with security settings and protocols to understand the best practices in securing web services.
- **Performance Optimization:** Use the environment to test different configurations and their impact on the performance of services like NGINX, WordPress, and databases.
